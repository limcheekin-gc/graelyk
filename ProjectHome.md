Graelyk is a Grails-like plugin for Gaelyk (Groovy on Google App Engine). Graelyk allows for rapid development of CRUD applications using templated code generation. It has a library of Taglyk functions mostly derived directly from the Grails project's taglibs. It aims to be more lightweight than Grails and to integrate nicely with Gaelyk. It is also based on the Obgaektify project and thus use the Objectify-appengine library.
